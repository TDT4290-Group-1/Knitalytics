- Modifiability: It is important for the customer that it is possible to modify and add new features to the system with relatively low costs in time and resources. Ensuring modifiability will also be benifitial to the group during development, as it facilitates incremental development where new features can be implemented painlessly. Since the customer may wish to further develop the system after the project period, it is important that the codebase is properly modularized, with minimal coupling and with a high degree of cohesion, so that the system is easily modifiable by future developers.

- Maintainability: Since the group will not be maintaining the system after the project period, it will be important that the group follows established code standards and conventions for all aspects of the code base. This also includes god documentation, both within and outside the code, so that understanding the system and getting an overview the various modules can be done efficiently.

- Usability: The customer emphasized their wish for a clean, tidy and intuitive user interface. Our system will handle and represent huge datasets and statistics, so ensuring good usability will be crucial for acheiving this goal. However the end users of the system wil be "superusers", which means that user guidance/assistance does not necessarily have to be a huge focus. 



### Current solution 
The current solution for the customer is to visit several different sites to identify current trends
in the knitting community. Sites include among other things Google Trends, hashtags and com-
petitor analysis on Instagram and Tiktok. Dreamknit also browse different fashion magazines like
Vogue and Min mote and fashion brands like Holzweiler and Acne Studios. This research is done
continuously and daily manually by the product owners
